## Background 1:

California has become the first state to protect mobile application users by enacting a law that is, in some ways, similar to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU).  The GDPR 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas.  Please read this article: https://www.iubenda.com/blog/the-need-for-privacy-policies-in-mobile-apps-an-overview/ and review this web link as it discusses the EU more in detail  https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/who-must-comply/

### Question 1:  In what ways is this legislation different and in what ways is it similar to GDPR?

### Question 2: Given its differences, do you believe it will have a larger or smaller chance of success in the United States?  Finally, do you think other states will begin to follow suit?
 
## Background 2:

Access the “DoS Attacks on IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks & Its Proposed Solution” page and read/review Gupta and Garg’s paper.  In this paper they discuss DoS Attacks on management De-authentication, Authentication and Association request frames, and specific prevention methods.

### Question 3: Do you agree with their rationale/reasoning that by maintaining MAC address tables and using traffic filtering you can prevent and/or limit DoS attacks against 802.11 protocols?

### Question 4: What other methods have you seen, used within your organization, or believe have an ability to limit these attacks? (i.e., location-based DoS detection, Content Delivery Networks, Access Controls, Firewalls)
