For this module you will be reviewing six (6) case studies/analysis reports on ICS/Cyber Physical System/OT attacks; The Stuxnet Worm, BlackEnergy, CRASHOVERRIDE/INDUSTOYER, Ukrainian Power Grid 2016, Oldsmar Water Treatment Facility, and Colonial Pipeline. 

For each report, please answer the below questions and submit your write-up in either PDF or Word format.  If you like you can submit one paper which covers all 6 use cases. Please indicate the title of each case study, as well as the question you are discussing. 

Each case study should be 2 pages in length. 

Follow APA Format, 6th Edition guidance for formatting and referencing sources. 

 

Questions to answer for each study are:

    What was the adversaryâ€™s method/TTP used (e.g malware, spear-phishing, etc.)?
    How did the malware spread?,
    In your opinion, what part of the ICS Kill Chain Mapping aided the most in the success of the attack?
    What are some of the recommended defensive mechanisms that could be used to prevent these attacks in the future?

 

Note: use the ICS Cyber Kill Chain renderings to answer Q3 for each case study.  Attached here:  Different ICS Cyber Kill Chain renderings.pdf

Note: I attached a pdf titled "rubric for short paper.Module 13.pdf" which covers how I will be grading.  Can use the MITRE ATT&CK framework links contained within this module to assist with assignment.
