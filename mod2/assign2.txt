Module 2 - Assignment: SiLK Toolkit

    Due Wednesday by 11:59pm Points 100 Submitting a text entry box or a file upload

In this assignment you will:

    Set up a SiLK collector  (or another NetFlow Tool, e.g., Wireshark)
    Gather network traffic from your own home network
    Analyze the resulting NetFlow
    Submit your assignment as either pdf or doc format

The assignment will be evaluated for accuracy and correctness. It is expected that you discuss any difficulties in the SiLK collector setup, include a summary of your home network traffic configuration, note any other abnormal traffic observed, and answer all the above questions.

 

Please pay attention to the two "Notes" on the assignment.  As one states "Students are allowed to use Wireshark instead of SiLK, or another NetFlow collector/analyzer, after honest/due diligent efforts have been attempted with SiLK."   

if you use another tool other than SiLK, please indicate which tool you used.

 

Due next Wed, @ 1159pm EST

JHU Information Assurance Analysis Module 2: NETFLOW Assignment
In this assignment you will: (PLEASE LOOK AT THE "NOTE" BELOW)
 Set up a System for Internet Level Knowledge (SiLK) collector
 Gather network traffic from your own home network
 Analyze the resulting NetFlow
 Submit your assignment as either pdf or doc format
For this assignment you have a choice of downloading/using either the SiLK Release 3.19.1, or
3.17.2 tool suite from http://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/download.html and will need to use the
installation documentation available at https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/silk-install-handbook.html .
The Install Handbook is a comprehensive guide for configuring SiLK in a variety of network
layouts. In section 4 of the Install Handbook, you will find instructions for setting up SiLK flow
collection and analysis tools on the same machine. It is recommended that you use this
configuration for completing this assignment. Note you will also have to download and install
YAF http://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/. Once you have installed/configured, perform the following
actions:
1. Use the instructions from Section 8 of the SiLK Install Handbook to begin a data collection.
2. Open your web browser and go to the following websites: (provide screenshots)
a. http://www.cnn.com/
b. http://www.foxnews.com/
c. http://www.aleae.com/
3. Open a command line terminal and do the following: (provide screenshots)
a. Ping google.com
b. Run a traceroute to google.com
4. Continue collecting data for an additional 30-40 minutes before stopping your network capture.
(e.g host on which the capture is being performed, i.e. your computer).
5. Use rwfilter, rwuniq, and rwcut to filter your network capture to only TCP & UDP traffic to or
from port 80 and answer the following questions.
a. How many flow records did your computer produce when connecting to each of the
sites in Step 2?
b. How many IP addresses did your system connect to during your network capture?
c. How many bytes did your computer receive for each site you visited?
d. Was there a significant difference between the amounts of TCP &
UDP traffic captured? If, so what might account for the variation?
NOTE: SiLK can be frustrating for some to get installed & configured, but is a powerful tool
to use when analyzing NetFlow traffic. If after honest/due diligent efforts you find
yourself having minimal success or continued errors which prevents you from completing
this assignment, you may use Wireshark instead. I posted some additional guidance
in Module 2's "SiLK Helpful Hints and Guidance" section of CANVAS. Below are some
additional links:

It is expected that you discuss any difficulties in the SiLK collector setup, include a summary
of your home network traffic configuration, note any other abnormal traffic observed, and answer
all the above questions. NOTE: provide screen shots for questions 2, 3, & 5a,b,c,d.
