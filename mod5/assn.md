# Module 5 - Assignment

    Due Wednesday by 11:59pm Points 100 Submitting a text entry box or a file upload

Anonymity is a very hotly debated topic on the internet, and is the subject of active research and political activism. At the same time, it’s debatable how much anonymity is actually achievable – either passively or actively.

For this assignment, start by visiting the site spokeo.com and searching for yourself. Once you’ve done so, answer the following questions:

    There are tradeoffs against anonymity and identifiability, discuss what some of those are?
   
    Do you believe that anonymity can be achieved technically, or is there a legislative/political component to anonymity?
   
    Should anonymity be required in all network interactions, or in specialized ones only?
   
    The Onion Router (ToR) is designed to provide anonymity rather than confidentiality.  How does ToR establish anonymity for the user?  (reference the last three attached readings)
   
    From the readings, “The Challenges of Effectively Anonymizing Network Data”, Section 3.1 Anonymization Methods, talks about four techniques to achieve this; truncation, randomization, quantization, and pseudonymization.  Pick three (3) of these, do some additional research and explain how the method works?
   
    Is anonymity an achievable event or a futile pursuit due to advances in computing, increased attack surfaces/vectors, third party proxies, network port scanning, passive/active collection methods, and the use of digital data making anonymity difficult across platforms and applications?
   
    What are other technologies/methods for implementing anonymity on a network?  (i.e., mix networks, batching strategies, high-latency, low-latency anonymity systems, etc.)
   
    How does Zero Trust Architecture impact the ability to implement and maintain anonymity?  (reference the attached NSA Security Model pdf- found in this week's Readings) 

Very good link to reference/use in answering the above questions;  https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse571-11/ftp/anonym/index.html    (copy and paste into browser)-  Can be used to answer question 7 plus more research.

Please cite all sources.  Provide your reasoning/justification for all your answers.   Write-up should be 5-6 pages.

Submit in either PDF or Word document format.  Due next Wed @ 1159pm EST.
