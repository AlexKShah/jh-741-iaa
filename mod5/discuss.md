# Module 5 - Discussion

Click on the "Module 5 Discussion" link to access the discussion forum for this module.

Answer both questions on your initial response. 
## Question 1:

 "The Devil and Packet Trace Anonymization" (pdf provided in the "Readings" section) provides a detailed process for a.) producing an anonymous traffic trace of raw network data, and b.) anonymizing packets at the link, network, and transport layers (OSI layers 2-4).

 Consider alternative data sources such as HTTP or SMTP â€“ given a particular source of log data, what steps would be involved in anonymizing that trace?  (e.g. approaches to consider- deletion, encryption, generalization, masking the log data, obfuscation, etc.)

## Question 2:

 Discuss what fields in both Netflow and packet headers without payload data sources could be used potentially to break anonymity and their relative strength.

 

Students should post their initial responses and provide a thought provoking response to at least one (1) of their fellow classmates posts.

Note: Scholarly article about De-Anonymization of Large Datasets, will help answer Q2, attached here  Robust De-anonymization Datasets.pdf
