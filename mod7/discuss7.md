Question 1:

Many companies are discussing incorporating AI (to include machine learning) into technologies like Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This however, creates new challenges and risk for IIoT & IoT systems.  Describe some challenges and risk associated with this integration?  By introducing AI into new technologies, is the trustworthiness of the data in question?  Support your answer for being either for or against. 

NOTE:  can enumerate on 17 technical trust concerns: scalability, heterogeneity, control & ownership, composability, interoperability, integration, compatibility, synchronization, measurement, predictability, testing and assurance, certification, security, reliability, data integrity, usability, and speed & performance.

Question 2:

AI is being used in many facets of our lives from autonomous cars, chatbots that learn and mimic offensive languages to existing solutions that are responsible for an increasing number of decisions like benefit payments, mortgage approvals, and medical diagnosis.  There are four foundational elements of “Responsible AI” which include; GOVERN, DESIGN, MONITOR, and TRAIN.   Briefly describe each one and provide a persuasive argument for the ones you feel are the most important.  Support your reasoning. 
Question 3:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that has been incorporated into many industries and sectors within the U.S. and Globally.  Some feel that AI has become a disruptive force for 3 reasons; improvements made through Machine Learning, Cheaper & Faster for Companies to adopt, and AI gives a predictive advantage.   These reasons have led many scholars to believe that certain industries will be impacted by AI in the near future; some of which include; Healthcare, Banking/Financial Services, Customer Service, Logistics, Retail, Transportation, Cybersecurity, Marketing, Defense, and Lifestyle.  Pick 3 of these industries and explain whether AI will either positively or negatively impact them.  Support your reasoning.    


Question 1

The capabilities of AI/ML are varied and depend on the task and deployment. The Forbes article describes data quality challenges that can affect the performance and reliability of AI systems. In critical systems like Industrial Internet of Things deployments, poor data quality and reliance on AI decision making could cause inaccurate predictions to lead to failures. The article describes how over time these concerns can be addressed using proper monitoring and human intervention, but the goal is most likely to process data without human involvement. While we aren't there yet, there are examples that show companies are willing to put AI systems out there whether they're ready or not. While the data itself isn't untrustworthy, AI systems will be untrustworthy as data processing and human oversight can't fully prevent mislabeling, bias, and other errors from occurring in the data a system is trained on.

Question 2

The responsible AI principles govern, design, monitor, and train try to provide an accountability framework to address or corner some concerns around AI like privacy and bias. Govern involves using standards and guidance to implement best practices around ethics and regulatory constraints. Design involves building transparency, security, and privacy into AI systems. Monitoring bias, privacy, and security with human involvement should be part of evaluating an AI system in addition to its performance metrics. And training and evaluating employee use of AI helps to integrate and better leverage the use of AI systems. I think that governing and designing the system with critical considerations like privacy and guardrails are the most important elements of the four. Everything else flows from the initial stages of considerations and implementation, and the earlier on in the process the more likely that shortcomings and concerns can be addressed.

Question 3

The Spiceworks article notes that AI makes the most disruptive changes on industries that have an established data workflow, which means those industries have the most to gain from AI/ML. All of these advantages coming from AI/ML are focused on using data more effectively and accurately, either to iterate faster or to arrive at a more accurate conclusion than competition. The most data centric industries from those listed are finance, healthcare, and logistics. In healthcare, there is a focus on accurate data and a shift toward using it proactively or preventatively instead of reactively. So healthcare could benefit from AI to analyze health data like sensors and scans to reach diagnoses earlier and more accurately. AI could also benefit the paperwork heavy banking and finance industries to automate regular procedures to save customers time and money. It could also be used to analyze patterns in transactions to more accurately detect fraud, which helps consumers. However it could also be used to benefit the banks by deciding who gets loans and credit. Uses like loans and insurance are a crucial reason why these systems need to be regulated and aligned, but AI can make the decisionmaking more accurate from the lender's perspective. Logistics is also a data centric industry where AI can help predict demand and reduce waste, and cut cost/time by optimizing routes and automating customs checks.
